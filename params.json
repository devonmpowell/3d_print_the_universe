This seemingly mundane process created a variety of complex structures: In the same way that a river cuts its own course through a landscape, dark matter flows \"downhill\" through the cosmic gravitational \"landscape\" to create filaments (\"rivers\") that feed matter into dense haloes (\"lakes\"). \r\n\r\nWe have created the world's first 3D model of this \"dark landscape\" using state-of-the-art\r\ncomputational tools and 3D printing technology.\r\n\r\nThe 3D models are:\r\n- `fullbox_00.stl`: A full N-body simulation box at z = 0. This volume is 40 Mpc/h (~100 million\r\n  light-years) on a side!\r\n- [`halo.stl`](halo.stl): A zoomed-in version, centered on one dark matter halo, showing the filaments flowing into it\r\n- [`heightmap.stl`](heightmap.stl): A 3D realization of a \"3D plot\" of the line-of-sight projected density along one axis\r\n\r\n## Contents\r\n\r\n- iPython Notebook code for converting a volumetric density dataset to a 3D `.obj` file\r\n- `.stl` models suitable for 3D printing (converted from `.obj` using Blender) \r\n- Warning: `fullbox_00.stl` is 99MB!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nBy Tony Li and Devon Powell at Science Hack Day, October 4-5, 2014 at \r\nGitHub HQ, San Francisco, CA.
